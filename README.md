# 📱 Android Tracing and Analysis Toolkit - SliceDroid App

A modular toolchain for tracing Android kernel events using kprobes, parsing ftrace logs, and analyzing app behavior with advanced visualization. Ideal for dynamic analysis, app auditing, and research.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🐚 **Shell tracing script** using `kprobes` for I/O, IPC, Bluetooth, Camera, Audio, and TCP events
- 🧠 **Python parser** that extracts structured event data from ftrace logs
- 🌐 **Web app UI** to upload `.trace` files and explore results visually

## 🏃 How to run SlideDroid

### Source Installation
Download required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* If you want to run end-to-end example by tracing the android device and inspecting the results:
    ```bash
    python run_slicedroid.py
    ```

* If you want to upload a trace file to be analyzed:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    Then, in the menu, upload the trace.

### Use PyTrim inside a Docker container

1. Install `docker` (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

2. Clone this repository:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/SliceDroidTeam/SLICEDROID_APP
      ```

3. Enter the source code directory:

      ```bash
      cd SLICEDROID_APP
      ```

4.  Build docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t slicedroid .
    ```

5. Run docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run --network=host --it slicedroid
    ```

6. Then, you are ready to run slicedroid:
    * If you want to trace your device and run the webapp run:
        ```bash
        python3 run_slicedroid.py
        ```
    * If you want to upload your trace to be analyzed:
        ```bash
        python3 webapp/app.py
        ```
