\chapter{Introduction}

Smartphones have become an integral component of modern society, with the number of global users surpassing 5 billion and continuing to grow rapidly \cite{statista2024smartphone}. Among the dominant mobile platforms, Android—an open-source operating system developed by Google—holds a stable global market share of approximately 75\% \cite{statista2021android}. Its open-source nature, flexibility, and widespread adoption have cultivated a vast ecosystem of applications that enhance user productivity and social interaction across various domains.

Among these applications, messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, and Signal have gained significant popularity, playing a central role in both personal and professional communication. However, the ubiquitous use of smartphones for such purposes has led to the accumulation of sensitive personal data on user devices, including photos, contact lists, location history, and financial information, thereby raising serious privacy and security concerns \cite{verge2018facebooksms}.

Incidents such as Facebook's unauthorized collection of SMS texts and call logs from Android devices \cite{verge2018facebooksms} underscore the vulnerabilities within existing mobile ecosystems. In response, regulatory frameworks like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and national laws such as the UK Data Protection Act 2018 aim to enforce principles of transparency, data minimization, and user consent in data processing \cite{gdpr2018, dpa2018}.

Despite these legislative efforts, Android's current permission management system remains insufficient. Users frequently misinterpret the scope and implications of the permissions they grant, inadvertently exposing sensitive data to misuse \cite{feng2020survey, felt2012permissions}.

To address these challenges, it is essential to analyze application behavior—that is, the actual operations performed by an app, both in the foreground and background. Research has shown that discrepancies often exist between user expectations and actual app behavior, with applications executing hidden or unauthorized tasks \cite{uipicker2019, gorla2014checking}. Many detection techniques rely on the assumption that user interface (UI) elements accurately represent application functionality, an assumption that is not always valid \cite{nan2019uipicker}.

Behavioral analysis methods are typically divided into static and dynamic approaches. Static analysis examines application code without execution, identifying known malicious patterns. However, it is susceptible to evasion through obfuscation and polymorphism \cite{arzt2014flowdroid, enck2010taintdroid}. In contrast, dynamic analysis evaluates applications during runtime, monitoring behaviors such as system calls, resource consumption, and network activity \cite{xu2011crowdroid, lindorfer2014andrubis}. Among these, system call analysis is particularly valuable, offering fine-grained visibility into application interactions with hardware and OS-level services \cite{canfora2015syscalls}.

Kernel-level tracing is a powerful form of dynamic analysis, capable of capturing low-level system interactions with high precision. Android is built on a modified Linux kernel that orchestrates resource management and system processes via system calls \cite{love2010linux}. Tools such as \texttt{ftrace} and \texttt{kprobes} enable developers and researchers to trace kernel-level function calls, execution flows, and resource usage \cite{rostedt2023ftrace, kernel2023kprobes}.

\texttt{Ftrace} is a built-in tracing utility within the Linux kernel, optimized for performance and capable of monitoring execution latency and function call sequences. \texttt{Kprobes}, on the other hand, allows for dynamic instrumentation of running kernels, enabling targeted probing of specific code locations during runtime \cite{corbet2015drivers}.

Applying kernel-level tracing to messaging applications, however, introduces unique technical challenges. These apps typically exhibit complex, multi-threaded behavior, frequent background processing, and diverse interactions with system resources. Accurately profiling such behavior requires collecting and interpreting high-volume, high-resolution kernel data \cite{tang2017profiling, kim2016io}.

Despite the growing research interest in Android security and behavioral analysis, existing work has primarily focused on general application profiling or malware detection. Few studies have concentrated specifically on behavioral profiling of messaging apps using kernel-level data \cite{backes2015boxify}. Meanwhile, recent reports concerning the usage of secure messaging apps such as Signal by government and military officials have emphasized the urgent need for transparent, robust behavioral analysis mechanisms \cite{washingtonpost2023signal}.

To address these gaps, this thesis proposes a structured methodology for profiling the behavior of popular messaging applications on Android through kernel-level tracing using \texttt{ftrace} and \texttt{kprobes}. The proposed approach integrates Machine Learning techniques to process and classify behavioral patterns, aiming to enhance security diagnostics, user privacy, and system transparency.

\section{Motivation and Problem Statement}
\paragraph{Motivation}
The motivation behind this research arises from the necessity to bridge existing gaps between user expectations, regulatory compliance, and the actual operational behavior of popular messaging applications. Messaging apps process extensive personal data, creating substantial risks related to privacy violations and security breaches. Recent incidents involving unauthorized data collection by prominent messaging applications, along with revelations about governmental use of supposedly secure messaging platforms, underscore significant concerns regarding transparency and user trust.

\paragraph{Problem Statement}
Current literature lacks comprehensive kernel-level behavioral analyses of messaging applications, leaving critical privacy and security risks inadequately addressed. Thus, this research seeks to systematically explore kernel-level behaviors to enhance transparency, improve user trust, and provide rigorous technical evaluations of messaging applications' privacy implications.

\section{Android Architecture and Kernel-Level Access}

\subsection{Android Software Stack Overview}
Android is a layered, open-source mobile operating system built on top of a customized version of the
Linux kernel. Its architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, supporting a wide range of
hardware while enforcing clear boundaries between components. The Android software stack consists
of four major layers: the Application Layer, the Java API Framework (commonly referred to as the
Application Framework), the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), and the Linux Kernel.

The Application Layer hosts both system and user-installed applications.
These applications interact with the system via APIs exposed by the Android Framework.
The Java API Framework provides access to core system services such as activity management,
resource handling, content providers, and telephony. Services like \texttt{ActivityManager},
\texttt{WindowManager}, and \texttt{PackageManager} facilitate the lifecycle management and
orchestration of application behavior.

Beneath the framework lies the Android Runtime (ART), which executes application bytecode and optimizes it using ahead-of-time (AOT), just-in-time (JIT), or interpretation modes. Alongside ART are native libraries written in C/C++, including performance-critical components such as WebView, OpenSSL, and the Bionic libc. The Java Native Interface (JNI) allows managed Java/Kotlin code to call into these native libraries.

The HAL acts as a bridge between the Android Framework and the hardware drivers residing in the kernel. It defines standard interfaces that vendors implement to support various hardware components like audio, camera, sensors, and graphics. Since Android 10, Google introduced the Generic Kernel Image (GKI), which aims to further separate the vendor-specific hardware implementations from the core Linux kernel by introducing a stable kernel interface. This allows devices from different manufacturers to share a common kernel base while maintaining vendor-specific modules separately, simplifying updates and enhancing portability.

At the lowest level, the Linux kernel provides essential operating system services such as process scheduling, memory management, networking, and security enforcement. Android extends the kernel with additional features including the Binder IPC driver, ashmem (anonymous shared memory), and wakelocks to manage power usage. This kernel foundation ensures that resource access is isolated and controlled across all system layers.

\textbf{Figure 1:} Updated Diagram of Android Software Stack (source: Android Developers Guide~\cite{androidplatformdoc}).


\subsection{Application Layer and Process Lifecycle}
At the application layer, Android executes user and system applications packaged in APK format. Each APK includes compiled DEX bytecode, resources, native libraries, and a manifest file that defines app components and permissions. Apps run in sandboxed processes, each forked from the Zygote daemon—a minimal, preloaded system process that speeds up app launch time by sharing memory using copy-on-write.

The lifecycle of applications is centrally managed by the \texttt{ActivityManagerService} (AMS), which coordinates activity transitions, memory prioritization, and process states (foreground, background, cached). The \texttt{PackageManagerService} (PMS) handles component registration and permission declarations based on the manifest.

Apps follow a component-based model: Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Content Providers. These components interact with the system and one another via well-defined lifecycles and IPC through the Binder driver. Operations like binding to a service or launching an activity initiate system-level behavior—such as context switches or memory allocations—which are visible in syscall traces.

Binder IPC enables structured communication between app components and system services. Messages are serialized as Parcel objects, routed through the Binder driver, and trigger observable kernel events. These include context switches and transaction dispatches, which are measurable using tools like ftrace or kprobes.

Understanding transitions between app states (e.g., from idle to foreground) is vital in syscall-level profiling. For instance, foreground activation often leads to bursts of system calls such as \texttt{open()}, \texttt{stat()}, and \texttt{mmap()}—associated with UI initialization and resource loading. Such behaviors form recognizable patterns in kernel trace logs.
\textbf{Figure 2:} Android Application Lifecycle and Corresponding Kernel-Level Events.

\subsection{Android Runtime, Native Layer, and JNI}
The Android Runtime (ART) executes application bytecode using a combination of ahead-of-time (AOT), just-in-time (JIT), and interpretation mechanisms. From a kernel-level tracing perspective, JIT-related memory operations may trigger system calls such as \texttt{mmap()}, \texttt{write()}, and \texttt{mprotect()}, as ART dynamically allocates memory for optimized code.

Beyond execution, ART interacts with the kernel to manage thread scheduling and memory access—behaviors that appear in system call traces. In dynamic analysis, such patterns can be correlated with app lifecycle events or anomalous execution spikes.

JNI further extends the runtime by enabling Java/Kotlin code to invoke native C/C++ libraries. These native operations often bypass standard framework controls, introducing low-level file, network, or cryptographic actions. This is particularly relevant for behavioral profiling, as native code may perform sensitive operations that differ from those visible at the Java level.

In the context of this thesis, which focuses on dynamic kernel-level analysis, capturing system interactions initiated by ART and JNI is essential. It enables the identification of execution phases or modules that deviate from expected behavior—especially in apps that rely heavily on native components for messaging, encryption, or background communication.
\textbf{Figure 3:} JNI and ART Interaction with Kernel during JIT and Native Execution.

\subsection{Linux Kernel Fundamentals in Android}
The Android operating system is built upon the Linux kernel, which serves as the foundational layer responsible for resource management, hardware abstraction, and secure process isolation. In the context of behavioral profiling and kernel-level tracing, the Linux kernel plays a pivotal role, as all application interactions with hardware and system resources are mediated through kernel functions and system calls.

A defining feature of the Linux kernel is its mediation of access to CPU, memory, file systems, and networking via the system call interface. When an Android application invokes a function that requires low-level operations (e.g., file access or sensor usage), it ultimately issues a system call that transitions the execution context from user space to kernel space. This transition boundary is where most behavioral artifacts manifest, making it ideal for tracing.

Android’s kernel incorporates additional components such as the Binder IPC driver, ashmem (for shared memory), and wakelocks (for power management). These Android-specific extensions generate kernel-level events observable by tracing tools. For example, Binder transactions facilitate inter-process communication and leave traceable patterns that can reveal background behavior of messaging apps.

Security is enforced through UID-based process separation, Linux namespaces, and SELinux Mandatory Access Control policies. Each app operates in its own sandbox and is assigned a unique UID, ensuring isolation at the kernel level. Deviations from expected isolation, especially in privileged system calls, may indicate abnormal or privacy-invading behavior.

Kernel tracing tools such as ftrace and kprobes allow developers to monitor kernel execution paths. Functions like \texttt{ksys\_open}, \texttt{\_\_sys\_sendmsg}, or \texttt{\_\_schedule} can be instrumented to capture low-level events such as file access, message transmission, or task switching. These traces are then analyzed to form behavioral profiles.

\textbf{Figure 4:} User Space to Kernel Space System Call Execution Path.

\subsection{System Calls and Kernel Interaction}
System calls are the primary interface through which Android applications interact with the kernel. Every high-level operation, such as reading a file or creating a socket, is translated into one or more system calls. These calls serve as an unfiltered log of what the application is actually doing, independent of its declared permissions or advertised functions.

In Android, system calls are usually invoked via the Bionic libc or directly through JNI bindings to native code. Behavioral profiling benefits from capturing these calls in real-time to identify patterns that indicate unexpected or excessive access to system resources.

Kernel tracing frameworks like ftrace and kprobes, and to a more advanced extent eBPF, can intercept and log system calls for offline or live analysis. For instance, an app issuing \texttt{sendto()} and \texttt{connect()} calls repeatedly in the background may be exfiltrating data without user knowledge.

\textbf{Figure 5:} Categorization of System Calls for Profiling: I/O, Network, IPC, Memory.

\subsection{ Android Security Model and Isolation Mechanisms}
Android enforces a layered security model combining Linux kernel features with user-space controls. Each application runs in its own sandbox, identified by a unique UID and GID, restricting file and device access. This is complemented by the use of SELinux in enforcing mode, which uses MAC policies to define allowable interactions between system components and applications.

Filesystem isolation further ensures that apps can only access their designated directories (e.g., \texttt{/data/data/{package\_name}}). Attempts to traverse or access other app spaces are blocked unless the app has elevated privileges or exploits kernel vulnerabilities.

System call filtering through seccomp restricts the range of calls an app can make, reducing the kernel's attack surface. From a profiling standpoint, observing unauthorized system calls or failed access attempts provides insight into potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior.

\section{Messaging Apps: Characteristics  Privacy Implications}

\subsection{Functional and Architectural Overview}
Messaging applications are among the most widely used mobile software categories, providing real-time communication, media sharing, group messaging, and voice/video calling capabilities. Popular platforms such as Signal, Telegram, and Facebook Messenger serve billions of users globally, integrating deeply into daily communication routines.

Android, as the dominant mobile operating system, provides the primary distribution platform for these apps through the Google Play Store. According to public data \cite{statista2024messaging, googleplaydata2024}, Facebook Messenger has surpassed 5 billion downloads, Telegram exceeds 1.2 billion downloads, and Signal has more than 100 million installs. While usage varies by region, these numbers highlight the ubiquity and market penetration of messaging applications on Android devices.

Such widespread deployment across diverse hardware and Android configurations introduces heterogeneous behaviors in terms of network communication patterns, lifecycle management, and system-level operations. This diversity, combined with varying security practices among apps, renders them ideal candidates for behavioral profiling at the kernel level.

These applications typically rely on key Android components to support their functionality: foreground \texttt{Services} are used for persistent communication sessions, \texttt{Broadcast Receivers} handle asynchronous events such as network connectivity or message reception, and \texttt{Content Providers} facilitate access to structured data such as shared databases. All applications are packaged in APK format and structured using component declarations in the \texttt{AndroidManifest.xml} file.

Rather than detailing cryptographic implementations or privacy architectures here, which are explored in Section 2.2.3, this section focuses on the foundational aspects of app deployment, runtime behavior, and Android system integration that are relevant for low-level behavioral tracing.

\textbf{Figure 5:} Popular Messaging Apps by Feature Comparison and System Integration Characteristics.

\subsection{Privacy-Critical Behaviors and Resource Usage}
Messaging applications often initiate background services using components like \texttt{JobScheduler}, \texttt{AlarmManager}, and foreground services to maintain persistent communication channels—frequently waking the device from idle states using wakelocks \cite{androidwakelocks}.

Resource access is another key concern. Most messaging apps request access to sensitive resources such as contacts (\texttt{READ\_CONTACTS}), device location (\texttt{ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION}), microphone (\texttt{RECORD\_AUDIO}), and camera (\texttt{CAMERA}). While many of these are used legitimately during active user sessions (e.g., voice/video calls, media sharing), kernel-level traces often reveal such accesses occurring in the background without any visible UI activity—raising potential privacy concerns \cite{reardon2019leakage}.

Additionally, messaging apps rely on push notification services such as Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) to deliver messages. These services necessitate persistent TCP connections and background listeners that, when profiled, result in recurring system calls like \texttt{recvmsg()}, \texttt{poll()}, or \texttt{select()}. Furthermore, apps such as Facebook Messenger are known to incorporate third-party SDKs (e.g., for analytics or ads) that initiate background network connections and file I/O unrelated to core messaging functionality \cite{pi2018metadata}.

Metadata collection—such as timestamps, contact hashes, or device identifiers—is another privacy-relevant behavior. Even apps that implement strong encryption at the message content level (like Signal) may still generate system call activity that reflects metadata-related operations (e.g., \texttt{stat()}, \texttt{write()}, \texttt{getuid()}). In privacy-unfriendly apps, this is more pronounced and persistent \cite{signalprivacy2016}.

Finally, the use of native code through JNI can introduce kernel-visible activity that bypasses Android’s permission mediation layer. This is especially relevant for apps that offload cryptographic or media processing to native components. System call traces such as \texttt{mmap()}, \texttt{ioctl()}, and \texttt{openat()} often appear in these cases and can be captured using ftrace or kprobes.

These behaviors underscore the necessity of dynamic, syscall-level observation for detecting privacy-relevant activity and serve as foundational evidence in the behavioral profiling framework proposed in this thesis.

\textbf{Figure 6:} Typical System Call Patterns for Background Resource Access in Messaging Apps.

\subsection{Architectures, Privacy, and Cryptographic Models}
Messaging applications adopt distinct architectural and cryptographic frameworks that critically influence their privacy characteristics and observable behaviors at the kernel level. The majority of messaging platforms—including Signal, Telegram, and Facebook Messenger—use centralized client-server architectures, where backend servers handle communication routing, message storage, and authentication. Centralization supports multi-device synchronization and cloud storage but introduces privacy risks, such as metadata accumulation and continuous background socket activity (e.g., \texttt{connect()}, \texttt{poll()}, \texttt{recvmsg()}).

Signal utilizes a centralized yet privacy-focused architecture, relying exclusively on the Signal Protocol, a robust end-to-end encryption (E2EE) scheme ensuring forward secrecy, deniability, session-specific ephemeral keys, and the Double Ratchet algorithm for key management. The Double Ratchet combines a Diffie-Hellman key exchange and symmetric key cryptography, generating new encryption keys for every message sent, significantly enhancing security against key compromise \cite{signalwhitepaper}. Signal employs a custom Java implementation of the Signal Protocol known as libsignal, which provides cryptographic primitives and protocol management directly within Android applications, facilitating rigorous security auditing and simplifying integration. Kernel-level activities linked to Signal’s encryption involve system calls such as \texttt{getrandom()}, \texttt{mprotect()}, and \texttt{write()} during cryptographic operations. Signal's architecture avoids cloud synchronization and external dependencies, significantly reducing its syscall footprint.

Telegram implements a hybrid model, providing optional E2EE via "Secret Chats" but defaulting to server-side encryption. Standard conversations store plaintext messages centrally, enabling synchronization but increasing metadata exposure. This design results in elevated kernel activity, particularly frequent \texttt{send()}, \texttt{recv()}, and \texttt{stat()} calls for persistent synchronization and message retrieval.

Facebook Messenger exemplifies a privacy-limited centralized system, offering E2EE only within an opt-in "Secret Conversations" mode based on a derivative of the Signal Protocol. Default chats lack end-to-end encryption, incorporate numerous third-party SDKs for advertising and analytics, and generate extensive background system calls such as \texttt{open()}, \texttt{socket()}, \texttt{unlink()}, and \texttt{connect()}.

Storage models further distinguish these apps. Signal maintains exclusively local encrypted storage without cloud backups, minimizing kernel interactions. Telegram and Messenger utilize cloud synchronization for message histories, leading to increased kernel-level I/O operations (e.g., \texttt{open()}, \texttt{fsync()}, \texttt{stat()}).

Ephemeral messaging capabilities (disappearing messages) affect transient kernel behaviors, including short-lived file creation and memory operations like \texttt{madvise()}. Conversely, platforms that store logs or metadata generate repeated kernel interactions via persistent database accesses.

Finally, encryption key management significantly impacts syscall activity. Signal generates and securely stores keys locally using secure hardware or biometric-protected storage. Telegram and Messenger employ centralized key management, simplifying multi-device usage but requiring trust in backend infrastructure.

These architectural and cryptographic distinctions shape observable syscall behaviors, enabling kernel-level analysis to assess privacy implications effectively.

\section{Static vs. Dynamic Analysis}

The security and behavioral analysis of Android applications can be approached through two primary methodologies: static and dynamic analysis. Each offers unique advantages and limitations, particularly when it comes to uncovering privacy-sensitive behavior in messaging applications. This section contrasts the two approaches and motivates the use of kernel-level dynamic analysis as the foundation for the profiling methodology employed in this thesis.

\subsection{Static Analysis}
Static analysis examines the application code, configuration files, and resources without executing the application. Tools such as JADX, Androguard, and MobSF decompile APKs and provide insights into declared permissions, control flow structures, and third-party library usage. This method is effective for identifying potentially dangerous code paths, hardcoded secrets, or violations of best practices.

However, static analysis suffers from several well-documented limitations. It cannot reliably account for runtime behavior that is conditional, obfuscated, or implemented in dynamically loaded or native code. Additionally, it provides no visibility into real-world execution patterns, user interactions, or background operations initiated through APIs like \texttt{JobScheduler} or \texttt{AlarmManager}. From a privacy standpoint, static analysis cannot reveal whether declared permissions are exercised legitimately or abused in practice.

\subsection{Dynamic Analysis and Kernel-Level Tracing}
Dynamic analysis captures application behavior during execution, providing ground-truth data on runtime interactions with the operating system. Techniques range from high-level instrumentation using frameworks like Frida and Xposed, to lower-level monitoring using strace or custom logging APIs. For this thesis, we adopt kernel-level dynamic analysis, specifically through system call tracing using tools such as \texttt{ftrace}, \texttt{kprobes}, and \texttt{debugfs}.

Kernel-level tracing offers a privileged vantage point for observing all user-to-kernel transitions, regardless of the programming language, framework, or runtime environment used by the application. Unlike instrumentation at the application layer, which can be bypassed by obfuscation or native code execution, kernel tracing captures raw syscall activity including file I/O (\texttt{open()}, \texttt{read()}, \texttt{unlink()}), network operations (\texttt{connect()}, \texttt{send()}, \texttt{recvmsg()}), and cryptographic processing (\texttt{getrandom()}, \texttt{mprotect()}, \texttt{write()}).

This approach is especially relevant for profiling messaging applications, which often perform background operations, access sensitive resources, and engage in encrypted communications without user interaction. By analyzing syscall sequences and their temporal patterns, one can construct behavioral profiles that are resilient to static evasion techniques and indicative of privacy-relevant behavior.

\textbf{Figure 8:} Comparison of Static Analysis, Dynamic Instrumentation, and Kernel-Level Tracing Capabilities.

\section{System Call Tracing and Behavioral Analysis}

Kernel-level system call tracing provides a low-level, ground-truth view of how Android applications interact with the operating system. In this section, we explore both the technical mechanisms available for capturing such interactions and the analytical methods used to extract meaningful behavioral insights—particularly in the context of privacy-sensitive mobile applications such as messaging platforms.

\subsection{Tracing Interfaces and Instrumentation Tools}
Several kernel-level tracing tools are available in Android and Linux-based systems, each offering a distinct trade-off between overhead, observability, and programmability:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ftrace}: Integrated into the Linux kernel, ftrace provides function-level and syscall-level tracing, context switches, scheduling events, and filtering by PID or syscall. It is accessible via \texttt{/sys/kernel/debug/tracing} and optimized for minimal overhead.
\item \textbf{kprobes and uprobes}: Support dynamic, on-the-fly instrumentation at both kernel and user-space function addresses. Useful for attaching probes at points like \texttt{do\_sys\_open}, logging file accesses and argument values.
\item \textbf{tracepoints}: Provide predefined hook points in the kernel source that offer safe, efficient monitoring of events such as process creation, file access, or scheduler activity. Often used with tools like perf or BCC.
\item \textbf{strace}: A user-space syscall tracer that uses ptrace to log syscall invocations. Ideal for debugging but with high overhead and poor stealth, making it unsuitable for continuous profiling.
\item \textbf{eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)}: A modern programmable tracing interface allowing safe kernel extensions at runtime. It supports dynamic filtering, per-event logic, aggregation, and export to user space. Its adoption in Android is growing with newer kernels.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Table 1: Comparison of Kernel Tracing Tools}


\subsection{Raw Trace Data and Post-Processing}
The output from syscall tracing tools typically consists of structured logs, such as:

\begin{verbatim}
<...>-1234 [000] .... 10000.123456: sys_enter_openat: dfd=AT_FDCWD filename="/data/user/0/app/cache/image.jpg"
\end{verbatim}

These logs capture syscall names, parameters, timestamps, and context (e.g., PID, thread state). To extract insights:

\begin{itemize}
\item Data is filtered and cleaned to isolate app-specific syscall events.
\item Features such as syscall frequency, argument patterns, and return codes are extracted.
\item Aggregated traces are converted to higher-level representations (e.g., n-grams, histograms) for machine learning or statistical analysis.
\end{itemize}

Post-processing typically involves parsing tools like Python scripts, custom Bash pipelines, or tools like \texttt{perf}, \texttt{bcc}, and \texttt{Sysdig}. These allow for correlation with app state (foreground/background), event type, and time windows.

\subsubsection*{2.4.3 System Call Pattern Analysis and Behavioral Fingerprinting}
Beyond raw logging, system call sequences form the basis for behavioral modeling:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{N-gram Modeling}: Sequences of length n (e.g., \texttt{open()}  \texttt{read()}  \texttt{close()}) are extracted to build behavioral signatures.
\item \textbf{Clustering and Classification}: Using unsupervised or supervised techniques, apps are grouped by syscall profile similarity.
\item \textbf{Anomaly Detection}: Sudden spikes in system call rate or unexpected syscall usage in idle state may suggest abnormal or privacy-invasive behavior.
\end{itemize}

Such analysis enables detection of covert channels, SDK activity, cryptographic operations, or unauthorized resource access. For example, background \texttt{recvmsg()} and \texttt{sendto()} events may indicate hidden data transmission; frequent \texttt{getrandom()} and \texttt{mprotect()} calls often correlate with cryptographic routines.
