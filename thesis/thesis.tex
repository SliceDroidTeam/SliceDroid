\chapter{Introduction}

Smartphones have become an integral component of modern society, with the number of global users surpassing 5 billion and continuing to grow rapidly \cite{statista2024smartphone}. Among the dominant mobile platforms, Android—an open-source operating system developed by Google—holds a stable global market share of approximately 75\% \cite{statista2021android}. Its open-source nature, flexibility, and widespread adoption have cultivated a vast ecosystem of applications that enhance user productivity and social interaction across various domains.

Among these applications, messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, and Signal have gained significant popularity, playing a central role in both personal and professional communication. However, the ubiquitous use of smartphones for such purposes has led to the accumulation of sensitive personal data on user devices, including photos, contact lists, location history, and financial information, thereby raising serious privacy and security concerns \cite{verge2018facebooksms}.

Incidents such as Facebook's unauthorized collection of SMS texts and call logs from Android devices \cite{verge2018facebooksms} underscore the vulnerabilities within existing mobile ecosystems. In response, regulatory frameworks like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and national laws such as the UK Data Protection Act 2018 aim to enforce principles of transparency, data minimization, and user consent in data processing \cite{gdpr2018, dpa2018}.

Despite these legislative efforts, Android's current permission management system remains insufficient. Users frequently misinterpret the scope and implications of the permissions they grant, inadvertently exposing sensitive data to misuse \cite{feng2020survey, felt2012permissions}.

To address these challenges, it is essential to analyze application behavior—that is, the actual operations performed by an app, both in the foreground and background. Research has shown that discrepancies often exist between user expectations and actual app behavior, with applications executing hidden or unauthorized tasks \cite{uipicker2019, gorla2014checking}. Many detection techniques rely on the assumption that user interface (UI) elements accurately represent application functionality, an assumption that is not always valid \cite{nan2019uipicker}.

Behavioral analysis methods are typically divided into static and dynamic approaches. Static analysis examines application code without execution, identifying known malicious patterns. However, it is susceptible to evasion through obfuscation and polymorphism \cite{arzt2014flowdroid, enck2010taintdroid}. In contrast, dynamic analysis evaluates applications during runtime, monitoring behaviors such as system calls, resource consumption, and network activity \cite{xu2011crowdroid, lindorfer2014andrubis}. Among these, system call analysis is particularly valuable, offering fine-grained visibility into application interactions with hardware and OS-level services \cite{canfora2015syscalls}.

Kernel-level tracing is a powerful form of dynamic analysis, capable of capturing low-level system interactions with high precision. Android is built on a modified Linux kernel that orchestrates resource management and system processes via system calls \cite{love2010linux}. Tools such as \texttt{ftrace} and \texttt{kprobes} enable developers and researchers to trace kernel-level function calls, execution flows, and resource usage \cite{rostedt2023ftrace, kernel2023kprobes}.

\texttt{Ftrace} is a built-in tracing utility within the Linux kernel, optimized for performance and capable of monitoring execution latency and function call sequences. \texttt{Kprobes}, on the other hand, allows for dynamic instrumentation of running kernels, enabling targeted probing of specific code locations during runtime \cite{corbet2015drivers}.

Applying kernel-level tracing to messaging applications, however, introduces unique technical challenges. These apps typically exhibit complex, multi-threaded behavior, frequent background processing, and diverse interactions with system resources. Accurately profiling such behavior requires collecting and interpreting high-volume, high-resolution kernel data \cite{tang2017profiling, kim2016io}.

Despite the growing research interest in Android security and behavioral analysis, existing work has primarily focused on general application profiling or malware detection. Few studies have concentrated specifically on behavioral profiling of messaging apps using kernel-level data \cite{backes2015boxify}. Meanwhile, recent reports concerning the usage of secure messaging apps such as Signal by government and military officials have emphasized the urgent need for transparent, robust behavioral analysis mechanisms \cite{washingtonpost2023signal}.

To address these gaps, this thesis proposes a structured methodology for profiling the behavior of popular messaging applications on Android through kernel-level tracing using \texttt{ftrace} and \texttt{kprobes}. The proposed approach integrates Machine Learning techniques to process and classify behavioral patterns, aiming to enhance security diagnostics, user privacy, and system transparency.

\section{Motivation and Problem Statement}
\paragraph{Motivation}
The motivation behind this research arises from the necessity to bridge existing gaps between user expectations, regulatory compliance, and the actual operational behavior of popular messaging applications. Messaging apps process extensive personal data, creating substantial risks related to privacy violations and security breaches. Recent incidents involving unauthorized data collection by prominent messaging applications, along with revelations about governmental use of supposedly secure messaging platforms, underscore significant concerns regarding transparency and user trust.

\paragraph{Problem Statement}
Current literature lacks comprehensive kernel-level behavioral analyses of messaging applications, leaving critical privacy and security risks inadequately addressed. Thus, this research seeks to systematically explore kernel-level behaviors to enhance transparency, improve user trust, and provide rigorous technical evaluations of messaging applications' privacy implications.

\section{Research Objectives}
The specific research objectives addressed in this thesis are categorized as follows:

\subsection*{Primary Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Record the actual kernel-level behavior of widely used messaging applications.
\item Identify potential violations of the principle of data minimization.
\item Analyze mismatches between granted permissions and real-time resource usage.
\item Detect unauthorized or hidden access to sensitive user data.
\item Compare the behavioral profiles of privacy-focused apps (e.g., Signal) and more commercial alternatives.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Analytical and Technical Sub-Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop a tracing and profiling framework using ftrace and kprobes.
\item Classify system calls into functional categories (file access, networking, IPC).
\item Monitor transitions between app states (idle, active, background).
\item Collect and analyze kernel-level usage statistics per application.
\item Identify potential indirect data leakage through side-channel patterns.
\item Correlate traced behaviors with declared permissions.
\item Implement a web-based dashboard for behavior visualization.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Broader Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item Enhance transparency in how messaging apps behave at system level.
\item Improve user awareness of hidden behaviors executed in the background.
\item Demonstrate the value of kernel-level tracing for security and privacy evaluation.
\item Provide a structured and reproducible methodology for privacy-respecting behavior analysis.
\end{itemize}
